Demotivational Quotes Just because you are special doesn't mean you're useful. Today might be the worst day of your life, but it's just the worst one, so far. It's okay to not be okay, just remember that nobody gives a shit. If you wake up early, work hard and never give up, you will make your boss rich. Believe in yourself, there is nothing you can't screw up. Even if you change the world, it doesn't mean it won't change right back. It's never too late to go back to bed and cry.
