Mommy, what is that outside? Oh, that's the neighbor's new dog. Isn't he cute? Mom, the school booked for us today. Can you give me some money, please? Sure, honey. Let me see what I've got. Ooh, I know this isn't that much, but hopefully it's enough to get something. What do you mean, Mom? This is perfect. Thank you so much. So good. Oh my gosh, kid. You're really addicted to those things, aren't you? What? I can't eat a chocolate bar?
