The M134 minigun. Arguably one of the most fearsome weapons ever made. But here are three facts you probably don't want to know. First up, the cost. This beast can fire up to 6,000 rounds per minute, and it can drain your wallet just as fast as it empties a magazine. In just 60 seconds, you're looking at around 4,000 to 6,000 dollars worth of ammo, depending on the type. It's powerful, but expensive to operate, making continuous fire in combat a rare sight. Now, let's talk about its insane rate of fire. 100 rounds per second. That's 6,000 rounds per minute, achieved by its six rotating barrels powered by an electric motor. To put it into perspective, it can burn through a 4,000-round belt in just 40 seconds. Finally, the origins. Developed by General Electric during the Vietnam War, the M134 was built to protect aircraft from fast-moving ground targets. Based on the old Gatling gun, but supercharged with electric power, it earned the nickname Death Machine on helicopters like the UH-1 Huey, where it played a crucial role in military operations.
