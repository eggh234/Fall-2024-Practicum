In English, we say, let's go to the party! In Spanish, we say, vamos a la fiesta! Can you say, vamos a la fiesta? Get off my block, kid. Your block? Time to get the map. I'm the map! Dora, according to my location, we own this block. You heard the map, right? Or do you want to see what else is in my backpack? Fantástico! Let's go to the party! Vámonos, amigos, one and all!
