Hey, is this dog still available? Yeah, he's still available. Okay, perfect. I'm interested in buying him. But first, I want to know why are you selling him? It's not like he's a puppy and you said he's well-trained. So why get rid of him now? Yeah, he's a good dog, but I got rent to pay, man. I need to get my landlord a thousand by Friday, and he's the only thing I can really sell. Then why are you only selling him for 500? How are you going to get the rest of the money? Don't worry about that. Now, do you want to buy my dog or not? Yeah, I want him. I'll come and pick him up now. Okay, here's my address. Send the money. Sent. Hey, man, I woke up this morning and the dog's gone. Do you know where it could have gone? And why do you still have the listing for the dog up? The dog's right here. Are you interested in buying him? What do you mean am I interested? I literally bought him and brought him home yesterday. Cool story, bro. If you're not interested in buying, please don't waste my time. I already bought him yesterday. That is literally my dog. Well, he's back in my house, so he's mine now. Well, I want my damn money back then. Nope. The deal's done. Unlucky, pal. What the hell, man? How many times have you scammed people like this? I wouldn't call it a scam. It's more of a hustle. I told you that the dog was very well-trained. And that's because I trained him to come back to me no matter where he is. So you just constantly resell the same dog over and over again? Yes, exactly. Do you not have a job? This is my full-time job. In fact, this was my 375th time I've sold my dog. That's messed up, man, but I do respect the hustle. In fact, my neighbors were interested in buying a dog. Oh, well, send me their number. Thank you. Hey, have you got any idea where my dog is? He's normally back by now. Has your neighbor not let him out or something? Oh, did I forget to tell you? Tell me what? My neighbors are Chinese.
