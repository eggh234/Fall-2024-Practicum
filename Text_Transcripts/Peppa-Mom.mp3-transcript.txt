Hey babe, could you chuck this picture of Pepper and George in the rubbish while I'm out? Of course, babe. Or we could hang it up to remind you to use protection. Alright, I'm gonna go get trollied and lesbian cheat on you now. Alright, could you at least take this shit with you then? And also the picture? Do I look like their mother? Aha! She's class when she's drunk. Alright. Kids, what I'm about to do is extremely manly. Literally only men can do it. So you two girls might as well piss off upstairs. Oh daddy, please can we stay and watch? Go get daddy a beer. See? Mommy pig was right to trust me. Oh shit, she's gonna find out about the affair. It's okay daddy, we can use the picture to cover it. Yeah, good idea Pepper. Let's cover this massive mistake with a picture of some other ones. Nah, fuck that. This picture's triggering me too much. Let's just take the nail out. Okay, this is bad. But not as bad as that picture. Wait a minute, where's my beer? Oh Pepper, get out of the wall. I can't have you thinking you're on telly again. Pepper has made her own television. Turn that shit off! Pepper, your face isn't made for telly. Just look at your mother. Chris, would you pass Meg that brick for me? Cheers Chris. What about me? Shut up Meg. There. Your mother will never notice. Now that the blue jobs are done, you two girls can get to work. I'm home. Daddy Pig.
