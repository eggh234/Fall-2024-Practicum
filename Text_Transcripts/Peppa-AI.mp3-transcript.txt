Today, Pepper and George are escaping from their abusive parents. Stop the yapping, narrator. I've came out here for a bit of peace. Just wait until he realizes that he's double the size of the tent. Now all I need is food and television. Can't do anything right, for f**k's sake. I can't concentrate on a f**king empty stomach. George, it's time to grow up and become a man. Use hunter-gatherer instincts to get a fire going. Daddy Pig forcing his three-year-old son to be more masculine? He has to be under the influence of alcohol. Right, so I did bring food, but save some for us. First come, first serve. Alright, okay, so we are pulling pots and pans out of our a**holes. Now that's quite handy. This is the moment we have all been waiting for. Any room for one more? F**king hell. Alright, I'll just sleep outside. Oh, unlucky donut eater. Oh, f**ks off, you slag! You know, if you had half a brain, you could just go and sleep in the car. Wow, is that the narrator being useful for once?
