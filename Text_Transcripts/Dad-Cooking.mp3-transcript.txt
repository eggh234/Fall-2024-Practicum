Shitting hell! Daddy, you burnt my vegetable casserole for fuck's sake! Oh no, not the casserole. It definitely wasn't on purpose, baby! I've been slaving over this shit for fucking hours! Oh dear, whatever will we do other than get a Mucky's? We are not getting a fucking McDonald's. We need to eat healthier. And by we, I mean you, man-tits. Is that the McDonald's? I think the driver's here. Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Pigson. I am Brian Bear, the bailiff. Sorry, wrong house! Just eat, says she'll be here any second. You better mean it, Daddy. I'm sick of you letting me down! Fuck the stairs, let's take the lift. Okay, Daddy. Oh, you're gonna fart, ain't you? Enjoy your takeaway! Jesus Christ, your house fucking stinks! It smells like slow-cooked vegetable casserole. Damn, your wife must be a bitch. Okay, take care now. Oh, and don't forget to rate me five stars. I know where you live, remember?
