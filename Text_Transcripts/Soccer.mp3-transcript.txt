This player just made a 1000 IQ move and shocked his opponent. So, to make sure his team would receive a free kick, he intentionally left the ball on the line, without the incoming player noticing it. As the player picked up the ball, the nearby referee assistant noticed the ball was still on the pitch, and immediately raised the flag, giving him a free kick while his opponent remained shocked.
