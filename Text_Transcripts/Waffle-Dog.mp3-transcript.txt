This dog had the choice between the perfect waffle and the burnt one, but strangely he chose the burnt one. But to everyone's surprise he started bringing it over to his pig friend and handed it to him to eat instead and ate the good waffle for himself. But he didn't know that it was the pig's birthday and felt so bad, so he gave him a bath full of his favorite food.
